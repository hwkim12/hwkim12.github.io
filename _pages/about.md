I am a fifth-year Computational and Applied Math PhD student at the University of Chicago, advised by Prof. [Daniel Sanz-Alonso](https://sites.google.com/a/uchicago.edu/sanz-alonso/about?authuser=0). I also work closely with Prof. [Panos Toulis](https://www.ptoulis.com/).

My research interests lie in developing theoretical understanding and methodological tools for Bayesian/probabilistic modeling, and optimization strategies for problems arising from experimental design, statistical inverse problems and transfer learning. I am also keen to utilize existing statistical/computational tools to tackle scientific problems arising from social and biomedical sciences.

I am on the job market this year and looking for academic research positions starting summer 2024.

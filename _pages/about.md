I am a fifth-year Computational and Applied Math PhD student at the University of Chicago, advised by Prof. [Daniel Sanz-Alonso](https://sites.google.com/a/uchicago.edu/sanz-alonso/about?authuser=0). I also work closely with Prof. [Panos Toulis](https://www.ptoulis.com/).

Broadly speaking, my research interests lie in developing theoretical understanding and methodological tools for Bayesian/probabilistic modeling, bandit algorithms, and optimization/sampling strategies for problems arising from experimental design, statistical inverse problems and transfer learning. I am also keen to utilize existing statistical/computational tools to tackle scientific problems arising from social science and biomedical sciences.

I am on the job market this year and looking for academic research positions starting May 2024.
  
Methodological interests:
* Bayesian Inference, Gaussian Process.
* Monte-Carlo Method, Stochastic Optimization.
* Bandit Algorithms, Blackbox Optimization.

Domain interests:
* Active Learning, Adaptive Experiments, Computer Experiments, Sequential Experimental Design.
* Domain Adaptation, Distribution-Shift, Transfer Learning.
* Statistical Inverse Problem, Uncertainty Quantification for Differential Equation Models and Optimization.
* Computational Social Science, Dynamic Treatment Regime, Network Analysis, PK/PD Modeling.

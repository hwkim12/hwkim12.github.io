I am a postdoctoral associate in the statistical science department at Duke University working with [Eric Laber](https://www.laber-labs.com/) and [Simon Mak](https://sites.google.com/view/simonmak/home). Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. degree in computational math from University of Chicago, where I worked on statistical inverse problems under the guidance of [Daniel Sanz-Alonso](https://sites.google.com/a/uchicago.edu/sanz-alonso/about?authuser=0) and stochastic approximation/optimization with [Panos Toulis](https://www.ptoulis.com/).

My research interests broadly lie in developing computational/statistical tools for Bayesian/probabilistic modeling, various types of experimental designs, and sequential decision-making. I am also keen to utilize existing methodological tools to tackle scientific problems arising from domain sciences.

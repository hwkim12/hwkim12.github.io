I am a fourth-year Computational and Applied Math PhD student at the University of Chicago, advised by Prof. [Daniel Sanz-Alonso](https://sites.google.com/a/uchicago.edu/sanz-alonso/about?authuser=0). I also work closely with Prof. [Panos Toulis](https://www.ptoulis.com/). Prior to UChicago, I received an MMath degree from the University of Waterloo and a BS degree from the University of Michigan. 

Broadly speaking, my research interests lie in developing methodological tools for Bayesian modeling, uncertainty quantification, and experimental designs. Some of my recent works are on probabilistic/optimization methods for complex dynamical systems governed by differential equations. I am also keen to utilize existing statistical/computational tools for modeling infectious diseases, social experiments, and physical phenomena. 


Keywords:
* Bayesian Inference, Uncertainty Quantification.
* Monte-Carlo Method, Stochastic/Blackbox Optimization.
* Experimental Design, Computer Experiments, Active Learning.
* Statistical Inverse Problem.
* State-Space Model/Data Assimilation.
